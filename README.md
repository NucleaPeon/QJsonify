<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![QJsonify on Linux][product-screenshot-linux]](https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify)
[![QJsonify on OS X Snow Leopard][product-screenshot-osx]](https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify)
[![QJsonify on Windows 7][product-screenshot-win7]](https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify)

_A Windows XP is planned._

QJsonify is a project that aims to help developers keep their data local. There are many great online JSON minifiers and prettifiers, but all that functionality is easily accessible within the Qt5 Framework and this avoids submitting data across the network.

It's faster and more secure, you can toggle quickly between minified and prettified forms as well as print and export said json files in a couple clicks.

**Starting at v1.2.0, support for qmake is being dropped.**

### Oxygen Icon Licensing

This project includes Oxygen Icons <a href="https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Oxygen/Licensing">https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Oxygen/Licensing</a> which are licensed under the LGPL v3 (see LICENSE-LGPL3 file). All files under this license are located in the ``icons/`` directory except jsonify-* files which I created for the program logo. These also can be licensed under the LGPL v3.

The oxygen repo is old when checked out, some svg/svgz files may not be available for inclusion with the project. Latest commit is ``bff159d338fe08be09146a5ee17b9b6efa8a2c8d``. See https://github.com/KDE/oxygen-icons for latest repo commits.

Files not included:

* format-line-spacing-normal.svg*
* format-line-spacing-triple.svg*

### Built With

This project is built on a minimum Qt5 version of Qt 5.3.2. For OS X 10.6.8, you can download the Qt5 binary at my <a href="https://github.com/NucleaPeon/qt5-sle/releases/tag/v5.3.2">other repository</a>.

It is also tested using Qt5.15 on Linux amd64.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Starting at version 1.2.0, we depend on qt5menugen: a library that handles dynamic .json-based menu and toolbar generation. It was partially developed in this application (and others of mine) before being split into its own library.
Use version 1.1.0 if you want it all included, but there will be no support/added features going forward.

_Windows users should use either the v1.1.0 release or source until I figure out how cmake building libraries on Windows works and can add instructions for that._

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* git
* cmake (for CMake builds)
* clang >= 3 OR g++ >= 4.2 OR msvc
* make (OS X and Linux)
* Qt5 >= 5.3.2 (Though 5.3.1 **may** also be acceptable)
* For Windows 7:
	* Visual Studio with MSBuild.exe on your ``PATH`` (I'm using VS 2013)
	* Windows Driver Version kit (I'm using 7.1.0)
	* Git Bash is useful for cli builds
	* Ensure that Qt5_DIR environmental variable is set to something like ``C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013_opengl`` or ``C:\Qt\Qt5.3.2\5.3\msvc2013_64_opengl``
	* Ensure your path to windeployqt is on ``PATH`` (``C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013_opengl\Bin``)


### Installation

Clone and install the library repo:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NucleaPeon/qt5menugen.git
    cd qt5menugen/build
    cmake ..
    make -j2
    sudo make install
```

Clone and install QJsonify

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify.git
    cd QJsonify/build
```

**Additional Note**: Windows is currently the only statically built version of this Software. For OS X and Linux, you will need Qt5 installed to run it.

<hr>

* Using cmake on Linux or Mac:

    ```sh
	cmake ..
	make
	```

	Mac users should have a .app/ folder they can click on to run in the ``build/`` directory. To install: drag to your Applications folder.
	Linux users can optionally run ``sudo make install`` to install it.

* For Windows 7 on Visual Studio 2013

**v1.2.0 uses a library dependency. This is only for v1.1.0.**

Easiest way is to open project in Qt Creator and build, then navigate to directory, copy over .dll's or run ``windeployqt QJsonify.exe``

For ``cmake`` use Git Bash on main project directory. Not specifying the ``Configuration`` parameter will build the Debug release by default:

```sh
cd build
cmake ..
# Define Debug or Release for build type. "//" to specify an option is required for git bash, but only "/" for cmd.exe or powershell.
MSBuild.exe QJsonify.sln //p:Configuration="Debug"
windeployqt Debug/QJsonify.exe
```

Compress the Release/ or Debug/ directory and distribute.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

Please remember to avoid any c++11 code and any Qt 5.4.0+ introduced functions for ``Q_OS_MAC`` def blocks as this project must be compatible with Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8).

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, either create an issue with your idea(s) or fork the repo and create a pull request.

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
